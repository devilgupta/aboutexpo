    <h3>WHAT IS REACTNATIVE?</h3>
    <p>
        Well reactnative is a programming interface used by many programmers of this
         world and is one of the most proffesional interfaces of app developing used. The main 
         thing that we use in reactnative is 'Snacks' which is what we program it in. 
         The current online editor I am using is Expo and within expo we have Reactnative 
         Snacks and within Snacks we have the language which you program 
        in which is calles jsx programming. JSX is a combination of html, css and javascript.

    <h3>HOW IS EXPO AND REACTNATIVE HELPFUL?</h3>
    <p>
        Expo is very useful for people who want to design applications since it is based on a thing called "COMPONENTS"
        which is basically different parts of a app like a button can be a component, a text, a calendar etc. all are components and by using components
        and jsx coding we can create a decent application. Html can be used for actually designing it, css for styling it, and javascript for calling the components and dealing with the components.
        Since this is a very proffesional online editor so our creativity is unlimited and we can create anything we want.

    <h3>HOW DOES REACTNATIVE WORK??</h3>
    <p>
        Reactnative as I told earlier is based on a combination of javascript, html and css, this language is called jsx
        Reactnative is run on Snack in which we code so that our output can be visible in our phone as well as our desktop.
        Reactnative's main thing that makes it so unique is its simplicity in applying components and actually designing the app.
        Since there is nothing as classes in the expo, we use different files and inherit data from those files to create components 
        and we inherit that data from the components file. The 3 main components that come preloaded in our program our VIEW, TEXT AND BUTTON.
